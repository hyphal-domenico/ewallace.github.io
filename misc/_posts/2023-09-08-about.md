# Inclusivity Statement

At the Wallace Lab we believe in equity, diversity, and inclusion in science.
We believe in the importance of a safe and equal environment for all, where all lab members and colleagues can thrive.
Therefore, we as a lab are strongly against any form of racism, homophobia, transphobia, misogyny, ableism, or discrimination based on religion.
We strive to support our colleagues as best we can, to amplify the voices of BAME and LGBTQ+ minorities, and to speak up when needed.
In addition to this, we support our lab members with caring duties or dependents by offering a safe work environment and flexible work hours.
We are in on-going pursuit of open conversation and accountability, to be better colleagues and to make science more accessible for everyone.

We work within the wider community of the [School of Biological Sciences and its commitment to Equality, Diversity and Inclusion](https://www.ed.ac.uk/biology/equality-and-diversity).

# Join

If you are excited to probe cellular responses with a mixture of experimental and computational techniques, come work with us! 

We welcome specific enquiries from potential PhD students, masters' students, and from visiting scientists including ERASMUS.

We welcome specific enquiries from prospective Postdocs interested in applying for fellowships to work with us: send an email describing your interests in this lab, and attach a CV. 

What do we mean by "specific enquiries"?
Unfortunately, labs get so many spam-like generic emails about PhD places that *generic emails get deleted immediately*.
Instead, show that you have interest in our specific work, on RNA processing and environmental responses in fungi.
The ideal "specific enquiry" email would reference a specific paper we have published, and make some suggestions as to what you want to do next in response.
This could take the form of a 1-paragraph outline research proposal, or anything up to a page.
Those specific emails get thoughtful replies - just show that you've put in some thought in writing to us!

As part of our commitment to inclusivity, we will take particular care to respond to candidates from underserved populations.
