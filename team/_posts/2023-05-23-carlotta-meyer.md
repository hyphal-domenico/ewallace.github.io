Carlotta is a postgraduate student studying Bioinformatics. She joined the Wallace lab in May 2023 and is completing a project titled "A bioinformatic pipeline for single-molecule RNA image analysis in budding yeast".  The aim of this project is to write a pipeline to enable fully automated analysis of yeast smFISH images, quantifying the localisation of mRNA for different genes, using different tools and packages including big-fish, napari, skimage and cellpose 2.0. She is also aiming to make the pipeline accessible for non-expert users with little programming background.

Carlotta completed a BSc in Natural Sciences (Biology and Chemistry) at Durham University in 2021 and would like to pursue a career in coding tools and pipelines to aid biological research.
